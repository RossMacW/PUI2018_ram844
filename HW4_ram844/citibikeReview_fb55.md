# IDEA
ok, but you should justify it - why is it interesting?

# null hypothesis


ok, consistent with the idea. 

# formula H0

equations dont render (I realize they did not render in my notebook but you do not have to perpetrate my mistakes!) 
if they rendered you would see they are wron: inconsistent with the H0

you have : _$H_0$ : W_AfterNine/W_total - M_AfterNine/M_total <= 0 $ which is the opposite of your H0 in words (which was right)

# data

ok .but you are not done: you have the hours and the gender split but you need to group by before 9 and after 9 and take the 2 fractions. 

If you did that you would have reliazed that you have defined night and day incompletely: what is the end time of your night period? midnight? 8AM?

TEST:

it is a test for proportins, so Z tet for proportion and chi sq are appropriate
