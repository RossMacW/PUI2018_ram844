Homework 3 (Due 11:55PM 9/26/18)
Part 1: Used the bash terminal to create a new folder for homework #3 and assignment 1 which included a readme file and a test.csv file. committed and pushed this to Github. Then used git filter-branch to test.csv and its history.
Part 2 solution 1: Import print function from Python 3 into Python 2, import os, and import pandas. Use curl to transfer data from NYC Opendata to my ADRF account. Move the data to my PUIDATA folder. Then read the data into a Pandas data frame. Print out the firts 8 lines and the last 3 lines. Review the variables. Count the rows. Pick two variables to be plotted. Then plot them with x and y axis labels. 
Part 2 solution 2: Load an Opendata json file into the url variable and use it a s parameter to load into a pandas dataframe. Rename 3 columns. Plot the data. Then reformat the x axis labels to show dates more clearly. Tehn plot the other columns.
Part 3: Got hung up on Part 2
Part 4: ugh

I worked by myself on this homework and had a lot of trouble identifying a dataset to work with on Opendata NYC that didn't have significant problems with the data.  At deadline the file I worked with was too large for me to push my file to my github repo.
Very frustraing.  Ready to cry myself to sleep now.
