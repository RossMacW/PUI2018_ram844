**Content**



My suggestions include:
* Aesthetically, I like the grey blue and pink color scheme. However, I remember Professor Bianco saying that we should not use colors that have implied meanings (using blue and pink for sex as an example).  I suggest changing these colors to something without sex connotations.  
* The legend is nice because it is simple and straight forward.
* The title is also descriptive and straight forward.  However, I am curious why "Accidental Poisoning/Substance Use" is a separate category from "Accidents". Is one inclusive of the other?  The title or caption could provide this detail.  
* I also wonder: in what timeframe did these deaths occur?
* The "mean(deaths)" label implies that the unit is deaths, which makes sense but may not be descriptive for all audiences.  I suggest renaming the Y axis something like "Average Number of Deaths"
* Perhaps you could specify which data set it comes from?
* I like the grey background with the white marker lines.  It makes the plot easier to read.
* Finally, I would recommend moving the X axis title down slightly.  It seems to be crowding your column labels a bit.


CLARITY: is the plot easy to read? is it clear or confusing, are the quantities being visualized ambiguous? 

ESTHETIC: beautiful is a subjective judgment: you should not judge the plot on the basis of whether you think it is "beautiful", but you should judge whether its esthetic is functional to what it is meant to communicate. Are the colors chosen appropriately? Are the graphical elements used appropriate to represent the quantities being visualized? Are the graphical choices allowing you to focus on the right elements or are they distracting you?

HONESTY: is the plot honestly reproducing the data or is it deforming it, perhaps to emphasize a point?

Important YOU MUST SUGGEST IMPROVEMENTS TO EACH PLOT!
