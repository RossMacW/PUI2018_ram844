**My suggestions include:**
* Aesthetically, I like the grey blue and pink color scheme. However, I remember Professor Bianco saying that we should not use colors that have implied meanings (using blue and pink for sex as an example).  I suggest changing these colors to something without sex connotations.  
* The legend is nice because it is simple and straight forward.
* The title is also descriptive and straight forward.  However, I am curious why "Accidental Poisoning/Substance Use" is a separate category from "Accidents". Is one inclusive of the other?  The title or caption could provide this detail.  
* I also wonder: in what timeframe did these deaths occur?
* The "mean(deaths)" label implies that the unit is deaths, which makes sense but may not be descriptive for all audiences.  I suggest renaming the Y axis something like "Average Number of Deaths"
* Perhaps you could specify which data set it comes from?
* I like the grey background with the white marker lines.  It makes the plot easier to read.
* Finally, I would recommend moving the X axis title down slightly.  It seems to be crowding your column labels a bit.
