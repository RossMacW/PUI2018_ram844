**My suggestions include:**
* I suggest that you capitalize the words in the title and axis titles.
* I like that you included the units in your X axis.
* I suggest rewriting the Y Axis label to read "Number of Rides" or perhaps just "Ridership".
* I suggest rewriting the X Axis label to read "Trip Duration".  It seems clear that these are being collected in bins.
* The brown in the bars is clear and does not have any suggestive connotations. However, your first bar is not outlined, while each of the others is.  I prefer them with the outline, but I suggest you make them consistent either way. 
* I suggest including a legend. 
* You could specify what timeframe these trips occurred.
* I would recommend putting commas in the values on your Y axis to make them a little easier to read. 
* I like the dashed marker lines.  They make the plot easier to read.
* I don't think it is necessary to state all of the trip duration bins in the plot's main title.
* Finally, I would recommend moving the X axis title down slightly.  It seems to be crowding your column labels a bit.
